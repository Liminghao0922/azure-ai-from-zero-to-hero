# Azure AI — From Zero to Hero
**A personal learning journey with Azure AI, App Service, and .NET — updated weekly.**

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repo documents my **personal learning path** as I explore Azure AI and Azure App Service from the ground up.

It is not a finished guide yet — in fact, it’s **just getting started**.  
I plan to update this repository **weekly**, adding:

- C# notebooks (`.dib`)  
- Hands-on labs  
- Small sample apps  
- Architecture notes  
- Things I learned the hard way  
- Tricks that are actually useful in real projects  

If you're on a similar journey, feel free to follow along.  
If you see something wrong, feel free to open an issue.  
This is as real and raw as it gets — a growing knowledge base while learning.
