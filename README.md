# Azure AI — From Zero to Hero
**A personal learning journey with Azure AI, App Service, and .NET — updated weekly.**

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repo documents my **personal learning path** as I explore Azure AI and Azure App Service from the ground up.

It is not a finished guide yet — in fact, it’s **just getting started**.  
I plan to update this repository **weekly**, adding:

- C# notebooks (`.dib`)  
- Hands-on labs  
- Small sample apps  
- Architecture notes  
- Things I learned the hard way  
- Tricks that are actually useful in real projects  

If you're on a similar journey, feel free to follow along.  
If you see something wrong, feel free to open an issue.  
This is as real and raw as it gets — a growing knowledge base while learning.

## 📅 Progress Status

- **Current phase:** Foundation building  
- **Update cycle:** ~1 article / notebook per week  
- **Goal:** Build a complete "From Zero to Hero" series for Azure AI + App Service + .NET  
- **Target audience:**  
  - Myself (first)  
  - Anyone wanting to learn Azure AI hands-on  
  - Developers who prefer code-driven learning

I’ll keep a living progress log here:

This is primarily a self-improvement project,
so the roadmap and direction follow my own study plan.
